* the obvious use of the dfs in/out time (order) is represent each subtree as a single substring in an array

* it's also possible to do a very important function that's done otherwise using persistent data structures or HLD which is representing a single path in the tree an calculating it's value in log(n) time using binary search: By pushing each node twice, push it
