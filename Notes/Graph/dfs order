* the obvious use of the dfs in/out time (order) is represent each subtree as a single substring in an array

* it's also possible to do a very important function that's done otherwise using persistent data structures or HLD which is representing a single path in the tree and calculating its value in log(n) time using binary search: By pushing each node twice, push it once with the accumulative value from the root to this node when visiting the node, and push it again when leaving the node with the last value was in the array before pushing the node for the first time (inverting the node value)
