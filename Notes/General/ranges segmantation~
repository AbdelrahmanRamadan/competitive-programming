* in order to turn group of segments into non-overlapping segments such that each new segments is fully contained in one or more old segments and without being partially contained in any old segment, use this algorithm:
for (pair<int, int> i : old) {
	v.push_back(i.fi);
	v.push_back(i.se + 1);
}
sort(v.begin(), v.end());
v.resize(unique(v.begin(), v.end()) - v.begin());

for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
	// new segment [ v[i], v[i + 1] [
}
